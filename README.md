# Traffic-prediction-
In the system, it has been concluded that we develop the traffic flow prediction system by using a machine learning algorithm. By using regression model, the prediction is done. The public gets the benefits such as the current situation of the traffic flow, they can also check what will be the flow of traffic on the right after one hour of the situation and they can also know how the roads are as they can know mean of the vehicles passing though a particular junction that is 4 here. The weather conditions have been changing from years to years. The cost of fuel is also playing a major role in the transportation system. Many people are not 
able to afford the vehicle because of the fuel cost. So, there can be many variations in the traffic data. There is one more scenario where people prefer going on their own vehicle without car pooling, this also matters in the traffic congestion. So, this prediction can help judging the traffic flow by comparing them with these 2 years data sets. The forecasting or the prediction can help people or the users in judging the road traffic easier before hand and even they can decide which way to go using their navigator and also this will prediction 
will be also helpful.
